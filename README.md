## What does it do?

UnderBudget assists in setting up a personal budget and provides
analysis by importing actual data from external sources (e.g.,
GnuCash, Quicken, mint.com, etc.). While other financial applications
allow budgets for each expense category, UnderBudget differs in that
user-defined rules direct the assignment of imported data against
budgeted estimates.

## How do I run it?

Double-click on the provided "underbudget.jar" or run
`java -jar underbudget.jar`.

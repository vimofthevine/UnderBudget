				Get started by creating a new budget (File->New). Once you've
				got a budget, you have to create your estimated incomes and

				An estimate is anything that is expected to occur within the
				date range of the budget. There are three types of estimates:
				<ul>
					<li>Incomes : money earned (e.g., paychecks)</li>
					<li>Expenses : money spent (e.g., groceries)</li>
					<li>Transfers : transfers between accounts (e.g., credit
						card payments)</li>
				</ul>

<h2>Exporting from UnderBudget</h2>

<p>
	UnderBudget provides several options to export data for preservation or backup
	reasons.
</p>

<h3>Exporting Transaction Data</h3>

<p>
	Transaction data that has been imported from a 3rd party application may be
	exported to an XML file. This results in a much smaller file than the original
	import file since the transactions have already been filtered based on the
	start and end dates of the current budget.
</p>

<p>
	Exporting the transaction data is useful for creating an archive of a
	particular budget that can later be re-opened by UnderBudget (provided that the
	budget file has also been archived) without needing the original import file.
</p>

<p>
	The transaction export file can be selected as an import file rather than the
	3rd party ledger application’s file.
</p>

<p>
	To export the currently imported transactions, select the “Export” option from
	the File menu. A pop-up dialog will appear with export options. Select the
	“transactions” export type and choose a destination file name. Click the
	“export” button.

<h3>Exporting Reports</h3>

<p>
	The reports generated by UnderBudget can be exported to several formats for
	presentation or archival for later use without the need for the original budget
	file or transaction data.
</p>

<p>
	Currently supported export formats include a PDF document and a set of HTML
	pages (one per report). Additionally, the user can choose which reports are
	included in the export (the report summary, the comparison report, the
	blacklist report, the allocation report, and the balance report).
</p>

<p>
	To export the current generated report, select the “Export” option from the
	File menu. A pop-up dialog will appear with export options. Select the
	“report” export type, select an export format, and choose a destination file
	name. Mark which reports should be included in the export then click the
	“export button”.

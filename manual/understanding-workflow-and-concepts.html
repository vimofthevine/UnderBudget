<h2>Understanding the Workflow &amp; Concepts</h2>

<p>
	UnderBudget allows for a budget to be created and continually analyzed against
	transaction data during and after a budgeting period.
</p>

<p>
	A budget is a collection of estimates for a given budgeting period. Each budget
	is stored in a separate XML file.
</p>

<p>
	An estimate is a budget line item indicating an amount expected to be spent on
	any particular expense category (e.g., groceries, gas) or towards a specific
	expense (e.g., mortgage, bills). Estimates are also created for expected income
	(e.g. paycheck).
</p>

<p>
	Transactions are actual incomes and expenses imported from a separate,
	third-party checkbook or ledger application (e.g., GnuCash, Quicken).
</p>

<p>
	Once a budget has been created, defining income and expense estimates,
	transaction data is imported and matched against the defined estimates
	according to a set of rules (see Understanding How Transactions Are Matched).
	By comparing the expected (i.e., estimated) amounts to the actual amounts,
	UnderBudget can highlight on-track, over-budget, and under-budget areas.

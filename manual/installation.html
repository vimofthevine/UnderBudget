<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
	UnderBudget is written in Java, and is therefore cross-platform compatible with
	Linux, OS X, and Windows.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Note: At this time, no installers or custom launchers are available. All
	distributions are a zip file containing all necessary files and a
	platform-specific launch script.
</p>

<p>
	To install, <a href="download">download</a> to appropriate package
	and extract (WinZIP, tar, etc.) to the desired location on the target computer.
</p>

<p>
	To run UnderBudget, use the launch script included in the extracted folder
	(underbudget.bat for Windows and underbudget.sh for Linux/Mac).
</p>

<p class="note">
	Note: Optionally, Linux users can run “make install” to copy files into the
	appropriate system folders. A package is available in the AUR for Arch users.

<h2>Creating a Budget</h2>

<h3>Setting Up a Budget</h3>

<p>
	UnderBudget requires a budget to be set up in order to do anything useful. A
	budget is a collection of estimates and some meta-info about a budget.
</p>

<p>
	A new budget is created by selecting the “New” option from the File menu. A
	template file is used to populate the new budget with a default set of
	estimates. Once created, some info about the budget has to be defined. Budget
	info can be viewed and modified by selecting the “Budget Info” option from
	the Edit menu.
</p>

<p>
	Every budget has a name--some way for a user to identify a budget once opened
	by UnderBudget. If desired, a starting balance may be specified which will
	allow UnderBudget to calculated the expected and actual ending balance (the
	initial balance plus income less expenses). The budgeting period must be
	defined in order to fully utilize the features of UnderBudget.
</p>

<p>
	A monthly budgeting period requires that the month and year be specified. Once
	specified, the start and end dates are calculated as the first Friday to occur
	in the specified month and the Thursday before the first Friday of the next
	month, respectively.
</p>

<p>
	A yearly budgeting period requires that the year be specified. Once specified,
	the start and end dates are calculated as the first Friday to occur in the
	specified year and the Thursday before the first Friday of the next year,
	respectively.
</p>

<p>
	A custom budgeting period allows the user to define the start and end dates.
</p>

<p>
	At this point it is a good idea to save the new budget file by selecting “Save”
	from the File menu. Since it is a new file the user will be prompted for a file
	name. Additionally, the “Save as” option in the File menu allows a previous
	file to be saved as a new file with a different name. This is useful for
	basing a new budget off of an older one.
</p>

<h3>Defining Estimates</h3>

<p>
	After creating a new budget file, estimates have to be defined. The estimates
	can be seen by selecting “Estimates” from the Window menu or the estimates
	toolbar button.
</p>

<p>
	The meat of a budget is the income and expense estimates. UnderBudget accounts
	for two kinds of estimates--income and expense estimates. An income expense
	defines expected income for the budgeting period (e.g., paycheck). An expense
	estimate defines how much money has been budgeted or allocated towards a
	specific expense category (e.g., groceries, gas) or a specific expense (e.g.,
	mortgage, utility bills) that will occur within the budgeting period.
</p>

<p>
	Any number of estimates may be created and organized into categories and
	sub-categories (e.g., utilities, gifts). Each estimate is given a name to
	identify or describe the estimate and allows the user to provide notes or
	comments for the estimate. These notes are not used by UnderBudget, they exist
	only for the users’ convenience.
</p>

<p>
	Estimates require an expected dollar amount to be specified. This value must
	be a positive value, for income and expense estimates.
</p>

<p>
	In order to match imported transactions against the defined estimates, match
	rules must be specified for each estimate (see Understanding How Transactions
	Are Matched).
</p>

<p class="note">
	Note: Multiple rules may be defined for any given estimate by separating them
	with a comma.
</p>

<p>
	New top-level estimates can be created by clicking the “Add” button next to the
	income and expense headings, as appropriate. New estimates can be added to any
	category estimate by clicking the “Add” button of the category estimate.
</p>

<p>
	If a new estimate will be a category and have more specific estimates under it,
	it must be defined as a category estimate by checking the “Category” checkbox.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Note: At this point no estimates should have their “Final” checkbox checked.
</p>

<p>
	After all fields have been filled out, the “Save” button must be clicked to add
	the new estimate.
</p>

<p>
	Any estimate that has already been created can be modified by clicking its
	“Edit” button.
</p>

<h3>Creating a Custom Template</h3>

<p>
	If there are certain estimates or categories that are re-used often, they can
	be added to the new file template.
</p>

<p>
	Start by creating a new file and adding in all estimates that are desired for
	the template. Select the “Save as Template” option from the File menu. From now
	on all new files will contain start with the current set of estimates.
